# Titan project

An attempt to make a **web interface** to facilitate development of **Logstash configuration files**

##Â Installation

### Docker

The **easier way to deploy** this application is via the [docker-compose](docker-compose.yml) file associated with this project.

You will need to install :
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

Once the requirements met, just type in a terminal, once the project downloaded :

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

**Application** will then be available at http://localhost:8080/

### Manually

There is **no actual benefices** to install this program by hands, but if you want to, you need to :

#### Backend

- Install **Logstash v5.6.x** (a newer version could work, but it was only tested with this version)
- Install **Node.js 10.x**
- Install **dependencies of backend** with npm
- **Launch the node backend** using npm **as admin**

#### Frontend

- Install a **web server** such Apache or Nginx
- Configure it so one of the **virtual hosts** redirect to the [frontend](frontend) directory of this application
- Configure the **api_url** variable in the [main.js](frontend/js/custom/main.js) file to match the backend server url


## Deployment considerations

As we use a **real Logstash** to test the parsing of our logs, and he is a little **CPU hungry**, if this application is intended to be use by **multiple persons at the same time**, you should :
- Use a **dedicated machine**
- Each job parsing will use ~2.5 CPU for about 15s, so **the more CPU the better**
- **RAM isn't a huge requirements**, it will use about 1Go / job

> **In the future**, it will be possible to use **multiple backend**


## Development

If you want to participate to this project, you can use the [Vagrantfile](Vagrantfile) present in this project.

You will need to install :
- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)

Once done, go into a command-line and launch the VM:

```bash
# Create and boot the machine
vagrant up
```

You will then have the access to :
- The **frontend** at http://localhost:8080
- The **backend** at http://localhost:8081

## Contributing

All contributions are welcome: ideas, patches, documentation, bug reports,
complaints, and even something you drew up on a napkin.

Programming is not a required skill. Whatever you've seen about open source and
maintainers or community members  saying "send patches or die" - you will not
see that here.

It is more important to me that you are able to contribute.
